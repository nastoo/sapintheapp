# Sapin
### What it's supposed to do ? 
Sapin is an app retrieving public transports, and giving schedules. 

### Where it's working ? 
Actually, if you live outside of Grenoble, France, this is useless for you.
It's working only on line C.

### API Used
We are using SEMITAG API, available here : https://www.mobilites-m.fr/pages/opendata/OpenDataApi.html

## Know issues
### Pin appears after interacting with the map
We are working hard to resolve this problem

### Can't retrieve stop schedule
Semitag doesn't give a full public access to its API. 
We are unable to retrieve real time stop schedule :(
